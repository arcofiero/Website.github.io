Welcome to Project Vincent!

Your home directory (the place where you found this file) is located on
a file server running TransArc's AFS (Andrew File System) originally
developed at Carnegie Mellon University.

AFS provides improved performance and flexibility over NFS, but there
are some differences in the way AFS operates.

Authentication
	Under `plain' UNIX, the filesystem determines who you are via
	your UID (User IDentification) number.  AFS uses `tokens' to
	verify your identity.  Tokens have an expiration time.  If
	you've been logged on for a long time (over 8 hours) and you
	suddenly find yourself unable to access files you own, check
	your tokens and/or refresh them as described below:

	tokens				list tokens and their
					expiration times

	relogin				refresh all Kerberos tickets
					and AFS tokens

	unlog				delete tokens

File Protection
	Files in an AFS directory are protected by Access Control Lists
	(ACLs) rather than through their protection bits.  The `user'
	bits limit access granted through access control lists.  The
	`group' and `others' bits are ignored.  The `chown' and `chgrp'
	commands lose much of their significance under AFS since all
	file access rights are determined by ACLs.

	fs listacl <dir>		list the ACL on a given dir

	fs setacl <dir> <user/group> <access>
					modify access to a directory

	fs help				see other fs commands

	chlist -a <user> <your-username>
					make another user a member of
					your homedir group

	chlist <your-username>		see members of your homedir group
	
	chlist				list all chlist options

Quota
	The usual `quota' command does not interoperate with AFS.

	fs quota ~			List % of quota used by your
					  home dir.

	fs listquota ~			Detailed quota summary

	Other AFS directories can be used in place of ~, but quotas
	apply to an entire AFS volume and all files and subdirectories
	below your home directory are in the same volume.

If you have questions, you may use the command `olc ask' to enter them.
OLC, the OnLine Consultant, is monitored by a staff of Computation
